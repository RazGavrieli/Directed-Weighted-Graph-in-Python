## Introduction
This project was created for OOP class, October 2021, in Ariel University. </br>
Its an implementation of a Directed Weighted Graph in python. There are two main files: DiAlgo.py and GraphAlgo.py: </br>
##### DiGraph
Simple functions for creating a graph, adding\removing nodes and edges.
##### GraphAlgo
Contains a DiGraph, and has more advanced functions for analzying a graph. </br>
You can run Dijikstra's algorithm, run GUI, finding the center node and more..
</br>
</br>

## How to use - READ THIS
-Clone the project into your computer and run in the IDE of your choice. </br>
-Go to each import at first lines of each file, and install the different libraries. At this step the IDE should offer you to install the relevant packages. 
-Go to main.py and inside the `check()` function write the commands of your choice. </br>
There are 4 examples (`check0-3()`) in main.py for you to read and understand the way of initializing and running a graph. </br>
</br>
Note that depending on your IDE you might need to 'build' the project before running it. </br>
